          Hey friend, here i will share a bit about myself. My name is Artem
          Kovalskyi. I'm a young fellow originated from Ukraine. I'm 19 years of
          age and currently live in Vancouver British Columbia. I've moved here
          almost 2 years ago by myself and trying to build a new life here in
          Canada. Hope you will like this website!

          I'm currently enrolled into Cybersecurity course in CCTB coollege. I'm
          really interested in studying technology and maybe my career will
          depend on those preferences of mine. Beside IT field, i'm quite active
          related to physical activity. I like to workout, walk, play any sport
          i can compete in xD. Sometimes i also enjoy wathcing series or animes
          and even reading books. I think i need to concentrate on the last one
          since that is really beneficial for your development overall. Thank
          you for taking a minute to visit this freshly created website of mine.
          Below you will find more information reading my skills. You can also
          contact me using the contact form, feel free! Best regards!
